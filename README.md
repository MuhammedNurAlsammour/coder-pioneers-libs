## Overview

CoderPioneersLibs is a powerful Angular-based library ecosystem designed to accelerate modern web application development. Built with Angular 17.2.3, it provides a robust foundation for creating scalable and maintainable applications.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18.x or higher)
- npm (v9.x or higher)
- Angular CLI (v18.0.6)

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli@18.0.6
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MuhammedNurAlsammour/coder-pioneers-libs.git
cd coder-pioneers-libs
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

## 💻 Development

### Development Server

Start the development server with:

```bash
ng serve
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application features hot-reload capabilities for an enhanced development experience.

### Code Generation

Leverage Angular CLI's powerful scaffolding capabilities:

```bash
# Generate a component
ng generate component component-name

# Generate other artifacts
ng generate [directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module]
```

## 🏗️ Building

### Production Build

Create a production-ready build:

```bash
ng build --configuration production
```

The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## 🧪 Testing

### Unit Tests

Execute unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io):

```bash
ng test
```

### End-to-End Tests

Run end-to-end tests:

```bash
ng e2e
```

> **Note**: To use e2e testing, first install your preferred testing framework (e.g., Cypress, Protractor).
